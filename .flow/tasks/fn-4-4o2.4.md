# fn-4-4o2.4 Reorganize Giveaway tab with visual separators and grouping

## Description
Reorganize the Giveaway tab to improve visual grouping and reduce density using Gestalt principles.

### Problem

The Giveaway tab (popup.html lines 384-524) contains 6 distinct sections all at equal visual weight:
1. Giveaway toggle
2. Entry counter
3. Recent entries list
4. Winner selection
5. Live chat metrics
6. Viewer leaderboard / Recent bids

This violates Gestalt grouping principles - users can't quickly identify primary vs secondary functionality.

### Solution

1. Add visual separators (section headers with subtle dividers)
2. Group related features:
   - **Primary**: Giveaway toggle, entry counter, spin wheel
   - **Secondary**: Recent entries, winner selection
   - **Analytics**: Live metrics, leaderboards (could be collapsed by default)
3. Use subtle background colors to differentiate sections
4. Add section labels for clarity

### Files to Modify

- `src/popup/popup.html:384-524` - Restructure Giveaway tab
- `src/popup/styles/features/giveaway.css` - Add section styling
- Consider: Collapsible analytics section (reuse accordion pattern)

### Key Code Locations

- `src/popup/popup.html:432-523` - Winner selection through recent bids
- `src/popup/styles/features/giveaway.css:86-91` - Metrics grid
