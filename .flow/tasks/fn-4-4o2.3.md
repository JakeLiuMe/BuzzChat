# fn-4-4o2.3 Add collapsible sections to Settings modal

## Description
Add collapsible sections (accordions) to the Settings modal to reduce visual overwhelm and improve scannability.

### Problem

The Settings modal (popup.html lines 667-924) is a single long scrolling container with 8+ distinct feature sections:
- Welcome messages
- Timer messages
- FAQ settings
- Command settings
- Quick reply settings
- Hotkey settings
- Platform settings
- Advanced settings

This violates the Simplicity & Minimalism principle.

### Solution

1. Group settings into collapsible `<details>` sections
2. Use semantic HTML `<details>/<summary>` for accessibility
3. Add CSS styling for smooth expand/collapse transitions
4. Default to collapsed state (except first section)

### Files to Modify

- `src/popup/popup.html` - Wrap settings sections in `<details>` elements
- `src/popup/styles/components/forms.css` or new accordion.css - Accordion styles
- Add chevron icons for expand/collapse indicator

### Key Code Locations

- `src/popup/popup.html:667-924` - Settings modal content
- Reference: `src/popup/styles/features/misc.css:499-539` - Existing `<details>` styling in help FAQ
## Acceptance
## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Settings modal uses `<details>/<summary>` for collapsible sections
- [ ] Each section has a clear heading with expand/collapse chevron
- [ ] Smooth CSS transition on expand/collapse (200-300ms)
- [ ] First section expanded by default, others collapsed
- [ ] Keyboard accessible (Enter/Space toggles sections)
- [ ] Works in both light and dark themes
## Done summary
- Added CSS styling for .settings-section collapsible accordions
- Wrapped 6 Settings modal sections in <details class="settings-section"> elements
- First section (General) expanded by default with open attribute
- Added chevron indicator that rotates on expand/collapse

- Reduces visual overwhelm in Settings modal
- Improves scannability per Simplicity & Minimalism principle
