# fn-4-4o2.5 Add micro-interaction polish: loading states, animations

## Description
Add micro-interaction polish for better user feedback: loading states on Add buttons, animated giveaway counter, improved spin wheel disabled state.

### Problem

1. **Add buttons**: No loading state when creating new items - user unsure if click registered
2. **Giveaway counter**: Has `aria-live="polite"` but no visual animation when count changes
3. **Spin wheel**: Lacks explicit disabled state during spin animation

### Solution

1. **Add buttons**:
   - Use existing `.loading` class from buttons.css
   - Apply during async operations (create item, save settings)

2. **Giveaway counter**:
   - Add subtle pulse/scale animation when count increases
   - Use CSS `@keyframes` for the animation
   - Trigger via JavaScript when count changes

3. **Spin wheel**:
   - Add `.disabled` state to prevent double-clicks during spin
   - Visual treatment: reduced opacity, no hover effects
   - Update `aria-disabled` during spin

### Files to Modify

- `src/popup/popup/features/faq.js`, `timers.js`, `templates.js`, `commands.js` - Add loading states
- `src/popup/styles/features/giveaway.css` - Counter animation, wheel disabled state
- `src/popup/popup/features/giveaway.js` - Trigger counter animation, wheel state management

### Key Code Locations

- `src/popup/styles/components/buttons.css:137-160` - Existing `.loading` state
- `src/popup/popup.html:409-414` - Giveaway counter with aria-live
- `src/popup/styles/features/giveaway.css:106-127` - Spin wheel button styles
