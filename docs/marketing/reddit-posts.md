## r/whatnotapp (Primary target)

**Title:** I built a free Chrome extension that auto-welcomes viewers and answers FAQs during my Whatnot shows

**Body:**
Hey everyone! I've been selling on Whatnot for a while and got tired of typing the same "Welcome! Free shipping over $50!" messages every show.

So I built BuzzChat — it's a free Chrome extension that:
- Auto-welcomes new viewers with personalized messages
- Sends timed promo messages (shipping deals, coupon reminders)
- Auto-replies to common questions (shipping, payment, returns)
- Tracks giveaway entries

It works right in the browser — no extra apps, no login needed. Just install and toggle on.

Free tier gives you 50 auto-messages per show, which honestly covers most smaller shows. Pro is $9.99/mo for unlimited.

Would love feedback from other sellers. What features would be most useful for your shows?

## r/Flipping

**Title:** Tool I made for live selling — auto-welcomes viewers so I can focus on selling

**Body:**
For those of you doing live shows on Whatnot or YouTube — I was spending half my time typing the same welcome messages and answering "what's your shipping policy?" over and over.

Built a Chrome extension called BuzzChat that handles all that automatically. Set it up once, toggle it on, and it runs in the background during your shows.

The best part: it has AI-powered responses so if someone asks something your FAQ doesn't cover, it can give a natural-sounding reply.

Free to use. Just wanted to share since I know a lot of flippers here are getting into live selling.

## r/reselling

**Title:** Any Whatnot sellers here? Made a free chat automation tool

**Body:**
Quick share for anyone doing live selling — I made a Chrome extension that automates the repetitive chat stuff during shows. Welcome messages, timer promos, FAQ replies.

Called BuzzChat. Free tier is generous (50 messages/show). Works on Whatnot, YouTube, eBay live, Twitch, and Kick.

Not trying to sell anything — the free tier covers most sellers. Just thought it might save some of you time during shows.

## r/Whatnot (if it exists)

**Title:** Auto-welcome + FAQ bot for Whatnot shows — free Chrome extension

**Body:**
Built this for myself and figured other sellers might find it useful. It's a Chrome extension that:

✅ Welcomes new viewers automatically ("Hey {username}! Welcome!")
✅ Sends timed messages (shipping deals, follow reminders)
✅ Auto-replies to common questions
✅ Tracks giveaway entries

Free to use. Honest question — what other features would help during your shows?

## r/Entrepreneur (broader audience)

**Title:** I launched a Chrome extension for live sellers with zero competition — here's what I learned

**Body:**
I built BuzzChat, a Chrome extension that automates chat during live selling shows (Whatnot, YouTube, eBay, etc.).

The interesting part: there is literally ZERO competition. I searched the Chrome Web Store — not a single extension does this. The only competitor (WhatNotBot) was removed from the store.

Meanwhile, there are 24 active Fiverr gigs from people charging $10-$1000 to build custom Whatnot bots. Reddit posts asking for this tool go unanswered.

**What I built:**
- Auto-welcome new viewers
- Timed promotional messages
- FAQ auto-replies
- AI-powered smart responses (Claude Haiku)
- Works on 5 platforms

**Pricing:** Freemium. Free tier covers most casual sellers. Pro at $9.99/mo.

**Lessons:**
1. Sometimes the best opportunities are where nobody's looking
2. Chrome extensions have near-zero distribution cost (CWS does the marketing)
3. Live selling is a massive growing market that's underserved by tooling

Happy to answer questions about the technical side or the business model.
