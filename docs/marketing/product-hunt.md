AI-powered chat automation for live sellers

## Description
BuzzChat is a free Chrome extension that automates chat during live selling shows on Whatnot, YouTube, eBay, Twitch, and Kick.

Set up auto-welcome messages, timed promotions, and FAQ auto-replies — then focus on selling while BuzzChat handles the chat.

**What makes it unique:**
🤖 AI-powered responses — the only live selling tool with this
⚡ Zero setup — install the Chrome extension and go
🎯 5 platforms — Whatnot, YouTube, eBay, Twitch, Kick
💰 Generous free tier — 50 auto-messages per show

**Built for live sellers who are tired of:**
- Typing "Welcome!" to every new viewer
- Answering "What's your shipping policy?" 50 times per show
- Missing sales because they're busy typing in chat

## First Comment (from maker)
"Hey PH! 👋

I built BuzzChat because I was spending half my live selling shows typing the same messages. Welcome messages, shipping info, payment details — over and over.

The coolest part is the AI feature. Instead of rigid FAQ matching, BuzzChat can generate natural-sounding responses to viewer questions using Claude Haiku. It sounds like you, not a robot.

There's literally zero competition in this space — I checked. The Chrome Web Store has label printers and analytics tools for Whatnot sellers, but not a single chat automation tool.

Free tier is generous (50 messages/show). Would love your feedback!"
