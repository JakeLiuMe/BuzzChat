# BuzzChat YouTube Video Script
**Title:** "How I 10x'd My Whatnot Chat Engagement (Free Tool)"
**Length:** 2-3 minutes

---

## HOOK (0:00-0:15)
"If you're a Whatnot seller and you're tired of typing the same welcome messages and shipping answers during every single show... I built something that does it all for you. For free."

## PROBLEM (0:15-0:30)
*Show screen recording of a Whatnot live show with chat flying by*
"During a live show, you're trying to sell, engage with buyers, handle questions — and meanwhile everyone's asking 'what's your shipping policy?' for the 50th time. You can't type fast enough."

## SOLUTION (0:30-1:00)
*Show BuzzChat extension being installed*
"This is BuzzChat. It's a free Chrome extension. You install it, set up your messages, and it handles the repetitive stuff automatically."

*Show the popup UI:*
"Welcome messages — it welcomes every new viewer by name."
"Timer messages — sends your shipping deal or coupon code every 5 minutes."
"FAQ replies — someone asks about shipping? It auto-responds."

## AI FEATURE (1:00-1:30)
"But here's the killer feature nobody else has — AI-powered responses."
*Show AI responding to a viewer question naturally*
"If someone asks something your FAQ doesn't cover, BuzzChat uses AI to give a natural, helpful response. It doesn't sound like a bot. It sounds like you."

## DEMO (1:30-2:15)
*Live screen recording of BuzzChat running during a show*
"Watch — new viewer joins... boom, welcomed automatically. Someone asks about returns... FAQ fires. Timer message goes out with the shipping deal. And I didn't touch my keyboard once."

## PRICING (2:15-2:30)
"Free tier gives you 50 auto-messages per show — that covers most shows honestly. Pro is $9.99 a month for unlimited. That's less than one sale on most shows."

## CTA (2:30-2:45)
"Link in the description. Install it before your next show. Trust me, once you try it, you won't go back to typing everything manually."

*Show Chrome Web Store link on screen*
