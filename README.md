## 😤 The Problem

You're live selling. Chat is flying. Someone asks about shipping — again. Another buyer claims an item but you missed it. A VIP customer joins and you didn't notice.

**Sound familiar?**

Live selling is chaos. You're supposed to be entertaining, showcasing products, AND managing chat. Something always slips through.

## ✨ The Solution

BuzzChat is your AI co-pilot for live streams. It watches chat so you don't have to.

```
💬 Buyer: "Is the Jordan 4 still available?"
🐝 BuzzChat: "Yes! Jordan 4 Retro is available — $220. Say SOLD to claim! 🔥"

💬 Buyer: "SOLD"
🐝 BuzzChat: ✅ Marked as sold, updated inventory, added to buyer profile
```

**You focus on selling. BuzzChat handles the rest.**
